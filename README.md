fridayProject1 - Mad Libs Game
This program is a simple Mad Libs game where the user is prompted to provide different words (such as a large object, body part, food, etc.). Once the user has provided all the words, the program generates a fun and humorous story by inserting the user's words into a predefined template.

fridayProject2 - PowerBall Lottery Number Generator
This project is a PowerBall Lottery Number Generator that helps users generate random numbers for their PowerBall ticket. In PowerBall, five numbers (white balls) are chosen from a pool of numbers between 1 and 69, and one additional number (red ball) is chosen from a pool of numbers between 1 and 26. Our program simulates this process by generating and printing out six random numbers for a PowerBall ticket.
