fridayProject2 - PowerBall Lottery Number Generator
This project is a PowerBall Lottery Number Generator that helps users generate random numbers for their PowerBall ticket. In PowerBall, five numbers (white balls) are chosen from a pool of numbers between 1 and 69, and one additional number (red ball) is chosen from a pool of numbers between 1 and 26. Our program simulates this process by generating and printing out six random numbers for a PowerBall ticket.

The game also allows the user to choose whether they want to play or not.
